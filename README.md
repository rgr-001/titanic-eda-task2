# Titanic Dataset - EDA

## 📊 Description
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to find patterns in passenger survival using visualizations and statistics.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
- File: `Titanic-Dataset.csv`

## ✅ Tasks Performed
- Loaded and cleaned dataset
- Checked nulls and types
- Descriptive statistics
- Histograms, boxplots, correlation heatmap
- Skewness check
- Interactive charts (Plotly)

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## 📌 Observations
- Fare and Age are skewed with outliers
- Higher class and fare → more survival
- Most passengers were in 3rd class
